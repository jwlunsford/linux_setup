# Udacity Linux Server Configuration Project
This project involves configuration for a Linux Ubuntu box hosted on Amazon Lightsail.  This setup is configured to run an Apache 2.4.18 web server, and host a data-driven web application using Flask.  This project was completed as part of the **Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree Course**

## Ubuntu Linux Instance Information:
The Ubuntu instance is hosted on Amazon Lightsail.  Details about this instance follow.
* Public IP Address `3.80.67.155`, SSH Port `2200`
* URL to the Hosted Flask Application `http://3.80.67.155/myApp/`

## Software Installed
Additional software required to complete this project needed to be installed to the Ubuntu instance.  The following were installed from the Linux Distrubutions using `sudo apt-get install` at a shell terminal prompt.
* Apache 2.4.18
* Mod_WSGI package for Apache
* PostgreSQL 9.5
* Git
* Python 3.5.2
* Pip
* Psycopg2

## Ubuntu Configuration Changes
* Changed SSH Port from 22 to 2200
* Configured UFW Firewall to only allow incomming connections for SSH, HTTP, and NTP
* Added an additional Unix user with sudo access
* Added an alias in _bashrc_ file: `alias python=python3` to use Python3 version instead of default 2.7 installed with Ubuntu.
